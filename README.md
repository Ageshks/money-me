# money_tracker

A new Flutter project.

ðŸš€ Introducing My Calendar Expense Tracker! ðŸ“…ðŸ’°

Managing expenses can be overwhelming, but what if tracking them was as simple as checking your calendar? Thatâ€™s exactly what I aimed to solve with my latest projectâ€”a Calendar Expense Tracker!
âœ¨ Key Features:

âœ… Calendar-based UI â€“ View & manage expenses by date
âœ… Category-wise Expense Tracking â€“ Know where your money goes
âœ… Smart Insights & Summaries â€“ See trends at a glance
âœ… User-friendly Design â€“ Simple, efficient, and intuitive

it shows the expences on the date also it can auto calculate the totoal expences in the month



it is not connected to the database its only an flutter app 
it does not require any external database because i created the app with ## sharerd preference so it can work independent
